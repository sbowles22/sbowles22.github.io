As such, I didn’t get much of anything done. In leiu of this, I have taken the liberty to create a simple website to help journal the goings on of my project!</p> <p>Anyways hi, I’m Spencer Bowles, currently a computer engineering student at Purdue University, and I’m spending the bulk of this summer focusing on a niche method of computing called the coherent Ising machine (CIM). For this project, I am working on a simulator called the CIM Modeling Interface (CIMMI). For those interested, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cimmi</code> repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/sbowles22/cimmi" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <h4 id="plans">Plans</h4> <p>I will say more about my project in the days to come, but for now I will outline some preliminary goals for this summer. For some context, I have been working on this project in a smaller (part-time) capacity for the past year-and-a-half, so the opportunity to focus for the summer should allow me to get significantly more done.</p> <p>The major items I hope to accomplish this summer are:</p> <ul> <li>Get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cimmi</code> into a working state</li> <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cimmi</code> to conduct tests on CIM noise</li> <li>Write my results into a report</li> </ul> <p>When it comes to SURF, there are a few assignments that I have to get done. These include:</p> <ul> <li>Literature Review (Due 6/7)</li> <li>Project Abstract (Draft 6/14, Due 7/5)</li> <li>Symposium (Draft 7/15)</li> <li>Paper (Draft 7/5, Due 7/22)</li> </ul> <p>There are also a few mini-conferences that I must attend. These are on 5/28, 6/18, 7/9; there is also a symposium 7/25.</p> <p>Well, I’ll stop procrastinating and get back to work! Have a good one!</p> </body></html>
