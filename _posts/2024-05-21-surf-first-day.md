Today we had our orientation for the SURF program. As such, I didn't get much of anything done. In leiu of this, I have taken the liberty to create a simple website to help journal the goings on of my project!

Anyways hi, I'm Spencer Bowles, currently a computer engineering student at Purdue University, and I'm spending the bulk of this summer focusing on a niche method of computing called the coherent Ising machine (CIM). For this project, I am  working on a simulator called the CIM Modeling Interface (CIMMI). For those interested, the `cimmi` repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sbowles22/cimmi).

#### Plans
I will say more about my project in the days to come, but for now I will outline some preliminary goals for this summer. For some context, I have been working on this project in a smaller (part-time) capacity for the past year-and-a-half, so the opportunity to focus for the summer should allow me to get significantly more done. 

The major items I hope to accomplish this summer are:
- Get `cimmi` into a working state
- Use `cimmi` to conduct tests on CIM noise
- Write my results into a report

When it comes to SURF, there are a few assignments that I have to get done. These include:
- Literature Review (Due 6/7)
- Project Abstract (Draft 6/14, Due 7/5)
- Symposium (Draft 7/15)
- Paper (Draft 7/5, Due 7/22)

There are also a few mini-conferences that I must attend. These are on 5/28, 6/18, 7/9; there is also a symposium 7/25.

Well, I'll stop procrastinating and get back to work! Have a good one!
