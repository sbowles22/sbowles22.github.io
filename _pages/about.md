My name is Spencer Bowles, and I am a computer engineering student at Purdue West Lafayette. I am also pursuing minors in both Physics and Philosophy. My main interests are physical computing (or any non-von Neumann computing techniquess), semiconductor workforce development, computer architechture, and algorithms for VLSI/synthesis. I am currently working with Dr. Peter Bermel to [efficiently simulate noisy coherent Ising machines (CIMs) for combinatorial optimization](/blog/) through Purdue's SURF program.
